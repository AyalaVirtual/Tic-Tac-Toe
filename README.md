### Rules 

  * Two players take turns clicking on a square to place 'X' and 'O' marks in empty spaces on a 3x3 game board.

  * Player1 starts first with the 'X' mark.

  * After each turn, players are shown a message displaying whose turn it is next, unless there is a winner or a tie.

  * Players cannot change the mark in a square that has already been selected or click the same square twice in one game. 
  
  * The first player to place 3 consecutive 'X' or 'O' marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

  * If there is still no winner by the time all squares on the board have been filled, the game ends in a tie.

  * Players will not be able to continue playing after a player wins or tie has been declared.

  * Players can start a new tic tac toe game if they wish to play again.

  * Players can keep score throughout multiple rounds and view the number of tied games and wins for each player.
